// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."

const implementation = "This is when the needs and design of the project have been established and they are being created ."

const design = "This is the stage of agile when it comes to desiging what you want the end result to be."

const maintain = "This is when the entire project is finished, but you are still maintaining the final product and ensuring its consistency in operation."

const analysis of requirements = "This is when you review and discuss the requirements that are crucial for the project to succeed and go over materials and costs."

const testing and integration = " This is when the product/code is ready for UX testing, followed by integration into the software."

const planning = "This is the first step; where the scope of the project is established, as well as resources and making an ideal timeline for the completion of the project."
